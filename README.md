# Tic-Tac-toe suicide game
### Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a bad game. Itâ€™s so horrible you want to lose. Write a Tic-Tac-Toe that forces your opponent to win. No need for a GUI. Command line interface and ASCII is enough, like
```
X| |
|O|X
O| |
```
You can take moves from input using a board layout as follows:
```
1|2|3
4|5|6
7|8|9
```
Can you write this atrocious Tic-Tac-Toe?
### How it works
Use artisan commands to play   
Available commands:
* `php artisan game:new` - refreshes all games (to finish old game);
* `php artisan game:play {row} {column}` - input row and column to make a move. You will get a result field (system will make a move too);
* `php artisan game:status` - to see if there is a game. You will see a current field.

logic is at [GameService](https://github.com/gen-maksim/interview/blob/master/app/Service/GameService.php) and in app\Console\Commands folder.
